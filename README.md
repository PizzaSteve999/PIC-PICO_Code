UART_test.X is the file to be opened as a project in MPLAB X IDE and uploaded to the PIC16F884-I/PT in order to enable UART communication.

The code currenly sends the letter A using the RC6/TX pin of the PIC microcontroller.

It can be modified to take digital inputs from the I/O pins and send this data.

This code is working and has been tested using MPLAB X IDE simulator.


UART.py is the code to recieve UART data on the Raspberry Pi Pico W and print it to the console.
